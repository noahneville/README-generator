  ## Description
  This project is designed to make the creation of README files as fast and easy as possible. The command line will prompt a user to answer a few questions and will use those questions to generate a README.md file that includes a table of contents, license badges and links to the users Github profile along with other standard sections of a quality README.
  
  ## Table of Contents
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Contributing](#contributing)
  * [Tests](#tests)
  * [Questions](#questions)

  ## Installation
  After downloading this repo to your local machine, simple open the containing folder in VSCode, Git Bash, or whatever terminal you prefer and type "npm i" to install all necessary packages.

  ## Usage
  Once you've installed, simply run the program using the command "node index.js" in the terminal. Answer all prompts and then check the 'output' folder when you're finished to find your README file.

  ## Challenges

  Overall I found this project pretty fun and didn't have a ton of difficulty with it. Upon refactor, one thing I'd like to do is come up with a more eloquent way of creating license badges and links. As it stands, I simply made a large array object to contain all of those links, but given how standardized the badges in particular are, I'm sure I could find a better way to generate those dynamically.
